        "\n",
        "Flask is a lightweight and flexible web framework for Python, designed to make it easy to build web applications quickly and with minimal overhead. It is categorized as a microframework because it does not require specific tools or libraries, allowing developers to choose their preferred components. Flask is particularly well-suited for small to medium-sized applications but can also scale to larger projects with the right architecture.\n",
        "\n",
        "# Advantages of Flask Framework\n",
        "1. Simplicity and Minimalism: Flask has a simple and straightforward design, making it easy for beginners to get started with web development. The framework is not opinionated about how to structure your application, providing flexibility in design.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Lightweight: Being a microframework, Flask has a small footprint, which means it is quick to install and run. It doesn’t include unnecessary tools or libraries, allowing developers to add only what they need.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Extensible: Flask supports extensions, enabling developers to add functionality as needed. There are many third-party extensions available for integrating various features, such as database connections, authentication, and more.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. Built-in Development Server and Debugger: Flask includes a built-in development server, making it easy to run and test applications locally. The interactive debugger provides detailed error messages, simplifying the debugging process.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. RESTful Request Dispatching: Flask provides tools for building RESTful APIs, making it easier to create services that follow the REST architecture.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. Template Engine: Flask comes with Jinja2, a powerful templating engine, allowing developers to create dynamic HTML content with minimal effort.\n",
        "\n",
        "7. Large Community and Documentation: Flask has a strong community and extensive documentation, making it easy to find resources, tutorials, and support for various challenges encountered during development.\n",

        "# Why Use App Routes?\n",

        "\n",
        "2. Separation of Concerns: By mapping URLs to specific functions, you separate the application’s logic from its presentation, making it easier to maintain and scale the application.\n",
