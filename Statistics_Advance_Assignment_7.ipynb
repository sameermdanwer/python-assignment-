        "\n",
        "* Null hypothesis ( H_0 ): The variances are equal, i.e., ( \\sigma_A^2 = \\sigma_B^2 ).\n",
        "* Alternative hypothesis ( H_a ): The variances are not equal, i.e., ( \\sigma_A^2 \\neq \\sigma_B^2 ).\n",

        "7. Decision: If the calculated F-statistic falls outside the critical values, we reject the null hypothesis."
