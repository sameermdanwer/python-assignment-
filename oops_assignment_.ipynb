        "The four pillars of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) are:\n",
        "\n",
        "# 1  Encapsulation:\n",
        "\n",
        "Encapsulation refers to bundling data (attributes) and methods (functions) that operate on the data into a single unit or class. It also helps protect the data by controlling access to it via getters and setters.\n",
        "Example: In a class, variables can be made private, and their access is controlled through public methods.\n",
        "# 2  Abstraction:\n",
        "\n",
        "Abstraction is the concept of hiding the complex implementation details and exposing only the necessary features or functionality. It allows focusing on what an object does rather than how it does it.\n",
        "Example: A user can drive a car (steer, accelerate, brake) without knowing the inner workings of the engine or transmission.\n",
        "# 3 Inheritance:\n",
        "\n",
        "Inheritance allows a new class (child or subclass) to acquire the properties and behaviors (methods and attributes) of an existing class (parent or superclass). This helps in code reusability and a hierarchical class structure.\n",
        "Example: A Dog class can inherit from an Animal class, and it can also have its own unique behaviors and attributes in addition to those inherited from Animal.\n",
        "# 4 Polymorphism:\n",
        "\n",
        "Polymorphism allows objects to be treated as instances of their parent class, even though they may also be instances of derived classes. It also refers to the ability of a method to perform different tasks depending on the object calling it (method overriding and overloading).\n",
        "Example: A draw() method in a Shape class can behave differently when called from Circle, Square, or Triangle objects, even though each one inherits from the Shape class.\n",
        "These four pillars—Encapsulation, Abstraction, Inheritance, and Polymorphism—are the foundation of object-oriented programming, providing structure, code reuse, and flexibility."

        "The __init__() function is a special method in Python, also known as the constructor. It is used to initialize an object's attributes when an object is created. The __init__() method is called automatically when an instance of the class is created and allows the class to set the initial state (values of its attributes) of the object.\n",

        "The __init__() method is not required, but if it's defined, it is typically used to set up initial values for the instance variables.\n",
        "The __init__() method can take arguments, which allow you to pass information during object creation.\n",
