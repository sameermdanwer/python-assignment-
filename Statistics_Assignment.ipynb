        "# 1. Descriptive Statistics\n",
        "\n",
        "Definition: Descriptive statistics summarize and organize the characteristics of a dataset. They provide simple summaries and visualizations that describe the main features of the data.\n",

        "Examples of Measures:\n",
        "\n",
        "* Mean: The average of a set of numbers.\n",
        "* Median: The middle value when data is arranged in order.\n",
        "* Mode: The most frequently occurring value in a dataset.\n",

        "# 2. Inferential Statistics\n",
        "\n",
        "Definition: Inferential statistics use a random sample of data to make inferences or generalizations about a larger population. It involves hypothesis testing, estimation, and making predictions.\n",

        "* Hypothesis Testing: Determining if there is enough evidence to support a specific claim about a population parameter (e.g., using t-tests or chi-square tests).\n",
        "* Confidence Intervals: A range of values used to estimate the true population parameter (e.g., a 95% confidence interval for a mean).\n",
        "* Regression Analysis: Assessing the relationship between variables to make predictions (e.g., linear regression).\n",
        "\n",
        "* Use Case: A pharmaceutical company conducts a clinical trial with a sample of patients to test the effectiveness of a new drug. By analyzing the sample data, the company uses inferential statistics to determine if the drug has a significant effect on patient outcomes compared to a placebo, thereby making inferences about the drug’s effectiveness in the larger population.\n",

        "The concept of levels of measurement, also known as scales of measurement, refers to the different ways that data can be categorized, measured, and interpreted. Understanding these levels is crucial because they determine the types of statistical analyses that can be performed on the data. There are four primary levels of measurement: nominal, ordinal, interval, and ratio. Here’s a breakdown of each level with examples:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Nominal Level\n",
        "Definition: The nominal level of measurement categorizes data into distinct groups or categories without any inherent order. The categories are mutually exclusive, and no mathematical operations can be performed on them.\n",
        "\n",
        "Example: Gender (male, female, non-binary) or Types of Fruit (apple, banana, orange).\n",

        "Example: Survey Ratings (satisfied, neutral, dissatisfied) or Educational Attainment (high school, bachelor's degree, master's degree). The order matters, but the difference between categories is not consistent.\n",
        "3. Interval Level\n",
        "Definition: The interval level of measurement involves numeric data where the intervals between values are equal, allowing for the measurement of differences. However, there is no true zero point, meaning ratios are not meaningful.\n",
        "\n",
        "Example: Temperature in Celsius (0°C does not mean there is no temperature; it is simply a point on the scale) or IQ Scores. The difference between scores is meaningful, but there is no true zero.\n",
