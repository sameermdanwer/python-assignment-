        "A database is an organized collection of structured information or data that is stored electronically. Databases are managed by Database Management Systems (DBMS) that provide users and applications with the means to create, retrieve, update, and delete data. Databases can range from simple data storage systems to complex systems that support large-scale applications, including transaction processing, data analysis, and more.\n",
        "\n",
        "# Key Characteristics of Databases:\n",
        "* Structured Storage: Data is organized in a way that allows for efficient retrieval and management.\n",
        "* Data Integrity: Databases ensure accuracy and consistency of data over time.\n",
        "* Data Relationships: They can represent relationships between different types of data, such as between customers and orders.\n",
        "* Query Capabilities: Databases allow for complex queries to be run to extract specific data.\n",

        "# SQL Databases\n",
        "\n",
        "1. SQL (Structured Query Language) databases are relational databases that use a predefined schema to organize data.\n",
        "2. Data is structured in tables (rows and columns) with fixed schemas.\n",
        "3. Requires a fixed schema; changes to the schema may require migrations\n",
        "4. Uses SQL for defining and manipulating data (e.g., SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE).\n",
        "5. Supports complex relationships with foreign keys and joins.\n",
        "6. Vertically scalable (adding more power to existing servers).\n",
        "\n",
        "# NoSQL Databases\n",
        "\n",
        "1. NoSQL databases are non-relational and allow for flexible schemas, accommodating various data models.\n",
        "2. Data can be stored in various formats such as documents, key-value pairs, wide-column stores, or graphs.\n",
        "3. Schema-less or flexible schemas; allows for dynamic changes without affecting existing data.\n",
        "4. Uses various query languages or APIs depending on the database type (e.g., MongoDB uses BSON, Couchbase uses N1QL).\n",
        "5. Typically does not support complex joins; relationships can be managed within documents or through application logic.\n",
        "6. Horizontally scalable (adding more servers to handle increased load)."
