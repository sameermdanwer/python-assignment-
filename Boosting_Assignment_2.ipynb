        "\n",
        "\n",
        "Gradient Boosting Regression is a machine learning technique that constructs a predictive model in the form of an ensemble of weak learners, typically decision trees. It is specifically designed for regression tasks and works by combining multiple models to improve prediction accuracy and reduce errors. Here’s a breakdown of its key concepts and how it operates:\n",
        "\n",
        "# **Key Concepts**\n",
        "1. **Boosting**:\n",
        "\n",
        "* Gradient boosting is a type of boosting where models are trained sequentially. Each new model attempts to correct the errors made by the previous models, focusing on improving the overall performance of the ensemble.\n",
        "2. **Weak Learners**:\n",
        "\n",
        "* In gradient boosting, the weak learners are often shallow decision trees (also known as decision stumps), which have limited predictive power on their own. These trees are combined to form a stronger model.\n",
        "3. **Gradient Descent**:\n",
        "\n",
        "* The \"gradient\" in gradient boosting refers to the optimization technique used to minimize the loss function. The algorithm uses gradient descent to minimize the residual errors from previous models.\n",
        "# **How Gradient Boosting Regression Works**\n",
        "1. **Initialization**:\n",
        "\n",
        "* The process begins by initializing the model with a constant value, which is typically the mean of the target variable. This constant value serves as the initial prediction for all instances in the dataset.\n",
        "2. **Calculate Residuals**:\n",
        "\n",
        "* After the initial prediction, the algorithm calculates the residuals (errors) by subtracting the predicted values from the actual target values. The residuals represent the difference between the true outcomes and the current model's predictions.\n",
        "3. **Fit a Weak Learner**:\n",
        "\n",
        "* A weak learner (often a decision tree) is then fitted to the residuals. This learner attempts to predict the errors of the previous model, identifying patterns in the residuals.\n",

Specifically, it refers to a base model that has limited predictive power but can contribute to an ensemble model when combined with other weak learners. Here are the key aspects of weak learners in gradient boosting:\n",

        "\n",
        "* A weak learner has an accuracy that is marginally better than random chance.
