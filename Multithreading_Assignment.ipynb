        "# Q1. What is multithreading in python? Why is it used? Name the module used to handle threads in python?\n",
        "\n",
        "Multithreading in Python is the ability of a program to manage multiple threads, where each thread is a lightweight, separate flow of control. A thread allows multiple operations to run concurrently in the same process space, meaning the code can potentially perform tasks in parallel (or seemingly at the same time).\n",
        "\n",
        "# Why is multithreading used?\n",
        "Multithreading is used primarily for the following reasons:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Concurrency: To allow tasks to run concurrently, which can make applications more efficient and responsive, especially when performing I/O-bound operations such as reading or writing to files, networking, or waiting for user input.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Improved Application Performance: For tasks like web scraping, database queries, and file I/O, multithreading can significantly speed up operations, as it allows different tasks to be executed without waiting for others to finish.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Responsiveness: For applications with user interfaces, such as GUIs, multithreading can ensure that the interface remains responsive while background tasks are processed.\n",
        "\n",
        "# Module used to handle threads in Python\n",
        "In Python, the module used to handle threads is called the threading module. This module provides a high-level interface for working with threads, allowing developers to create and manage multiple threads easily."
