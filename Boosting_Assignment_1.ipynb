        "\n",
        "* Train a simple model (the weak learner) on the training data. This model will likely perform poorly on complex patterns but should do slightly better than random guessing.\n",

        "\n",
        "* Evaluate the errors (misclassified instances) made by the first model. The idea is to identify which instances the model struggled with, so the next model can focus on these harder examples.\n",

After each weak learner (typically a decision stump) is trained, AdaBoost increases the weights of misclassified instances, so that the next learner focuses more on these hard-to-classify samples. Each weak learner’s prediction is weighted by its accuracy, and the final prediction is a weighted majority vote (for classification) or weighted sum (for regression).\n",

Instead of adjusting data weights, Gradient Boosting minimizes the loss function using gradient descent, with each new learner focusing on the residuals of the previous learners.\n",

        "# Q10. What is the effect of increasing the number of estimators in AdaBoost algorithm?\n",
        "\n",
        "Increasing the number of estimators (or weak learners) in the AdaBoost algorithm can have several effects on the model’s performance, generalization, and computational efficiency. Here’s an overview of these effects:\n",
        "\n",
        "# **1. Improved Model Performance**\n",
        "* Increased Accuracy: Generally, adding more estimators allows AdaBoost to capture more complex patterns in the data. Each weak learner focuses on correcting the errors of the previous learners, leading to improved accuracy on the training data and potentially the validation/test data as well.\n",
        "\n",
        "* Better Handling of Difficult Instances: As the number of estimators increases, the model can focus more on hard-to-classify instances. This targeted learning can help in reducing misclassification rates.\n",
        "\n",
        "# **2. Risk of Overfitting**\n",
        "* Overfitting to Noise: While more estimators can lead to better fit on the training data, they can also make the model more sensitive to noise in the data. If the dataset has outliers or irrelevant features, increasing the number of estimators might allow these noise points to influence the model too much, leading to overfitting.\n",
        "\n",
        "* Generalization Performance: After a certain point, adding more estimators may yield diminishing returns, where the performance on validation/test data starts to degrade as the model becomes too tailored to the training set.\n",
        "\n",
        "# **3. Increased Computational Cost**\n",
        "* Training Time: More estimators lead to longer training times since each weak learner must be trained sequentially. This can become computationally expensive, especially with complex models or large datasets.\n",
        "\n",
        "* Resource Usage: The memory and processing power required to store and compute predictions from additional weak learners will also increase.\n",
        "\n",
        "# **4. Diminishing Returns on Performance**\n",
        "* Saturation Point: There is often a point beyond which adding more estimators results in minimal improvements in accuracy. After reaching this point, the additional complexity may not justify the computational cost and could instead lead to overfitting.\n",
        "\n",
        "* Early Stopping: Techniques like early stopping, where training is halted if the performance on a validation set does not improve after a certain number of iterations, can be useful to avoid unnecessary computations and overfitting.\n",
        "\n",
        "# **5. Final Model Complexity**\n",
        "* Interpretability: With more weak learners, the final model becomes more complex and harder to interpret. Understanding the influence of individual learners may be challenging, especially in terms of decision boundaries."
